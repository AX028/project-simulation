ok so, 
for enemy AI, I want them to take into consideration
the characters armor, how armored each part is
in order to determine how to deal the most damage,
or how to survive the longest. 

Most beings are sentient, so they should prioritize 
their own survival, if they get low enough health, 
based on their bloodlust or their chances of survival,
they will try to run away are continue fighting.

General AI


Goal: Getting money
The Ai is rewarded everytime it finds money
Punished if it loses money
If you lose money for a prolonged period of time, you will lose points.

An ai rewards the model points if it is closer to achieving its goal and vice versa



For combat loop we can implement terrain as part of the modifiers or climate etc
