"""
Understand Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Basics: While you've integrated DQN, understanding the details of Q-learning and its principles (like exploration vs exploitation, Bellman equation, etc.) is crucial to fine-tuning the AI's decision-making.
Research:
1. Topics to understand about the AI
What is the DQN architecture?
How does experience replay and the target network work?
Techniques like Double DQN, Dueling DQN, etc., that can improve performance.
Reward and Action Design:
Ensure that your AI is learning from rewards correctly. You’ll need to adjust how the rewards are given (positive/negative reinforcement), especially in complex, long-term tasks.
Consider the delayed reward problem (where actions might not result in immediate feedback, making it difficult to learn).
State Representation:
Ensure the get_state_vector method represents your environment correctly and efficiently.
Your state should ideally be a comprehensive representation of all relevant features of the environment.
Action Space:
Check if your action space is broad enough. The actions you define should allow your AI to adapt to any situation, whether that’s talking, fighting, or other interactions.
Improvement: Experiment with different hyperparameters like the learning rate, batch size, epsilon decay rate, and gamma.



2. Memory and Experience Replay
Experience Replay Buffer:
Implement prioritized experience replay to help the model focus on more important experiences, which could speed up learning.
Memory Calculation:
Further refine the Memory class to ensure each stored experience is useful and the bias effects are accurately calculated.
Maybe incorporate temporal differences or use other memory structures (e.g., recurrent networks for sequence prediction) if your AI needs to handle long-term dependencies.



3. Emotion and Decision-Making
Integrating Emotions:
Currently, emotions are defined but not fully integrated into decision-making. You should research affective computing (how emotions influence decision-making) to make emotions like "anger" or "fear" more impactful.
Consider whether emotions should change decision weights, action preferences, or the AI's overall behavior.
Emotion Feedback:
Modify the behavior based on the emotional state of the character. For instance, an angry character may take more aggressive actions or avoid certain interactions.
Refining Emotion Effects:
The calculate_weight method calculates decisions based on weighted inputs. You need to fine-tune how emotions (like anger or fear) influence actions. Perhaps an AI in fear avoids fights or seeks allies.
Dynamic Emotion Changes:
Emotions should change dynamically based on actions and interactions. For example, if the AI faces a threat, it may experience a temporary spike in fear.



4. Character Interaction and Entity Behavior
Entity Interaction:
Add more depth to how your AI interacts with other entities in the world. These interactions could be emotional, strategic, or based on the current state of the game world.
Look into natural language processing (NLP) if your AI will engage in conversations. You might want to simulate more realistic dialogue or responses.
Behavior Tree or Finite State Machines (FSM):
You may want to integrate a finite state machine (FSM) or behavior tree to model the different behaviors (like idle, attacking, running) that your AI can exhibit. These models will provide a structured way to handle transitions between states.
Social Influence and Hierarchy:
If your AI is part of a larger system of characters, consider implementing group behaviors or social structures, where certain entities have more influence over the AI's decisions.



5. Exploration and Learning
Exploration vs. Exploitation:
Review your epsilon decay logic to ensure that your AI explores enough to learn but also exploits known strategies for effective decision-making.
Curiosity-Driven Learning:
Introduce mechanisms where the AI explores new behaviors or scenarios when uncertain, encouraging discovery through intrinsic motivation (like curiosity).
Learning from Failures:
Ensure that the AI can learn from failure, not just success. Failures (like dying, being defeated, or losing an opportunity) should provide valuable lessons.



6. Scaling AI Behavior
Scaling Complexity:
As your AI becomes more sophisticated, ensure that the logic doesn't become overly complex or difficult to manage. Aim for modularity and clear abstractions in your code.
Real-time Updates:
Implement real-time decision-making if the AI needs to adapt instantly to changing circumstances. This can involve more responsive algorithms or multi-threading in some cases.



7. Testing and Evaluation
Unit Testing:
Test individual components like get_state_vector(), choose_action(), train(), and the Memory class to ensure they perform correctly.
Test how the AI reacts to various conditions like different emotional states, environmental changes, and interactions with other entities.
Reward Shaping:
Analyze if your reward function is aligned with the long-term goals. Sometimes the reward function needs to be manually shaped to guide the AI’s learning process effectively.
Performance Metrics:
Develop clear metrics for measuring how well the AI is learning. You could track its success rate, emotional stability, or how efficiently it explores the environment.



8. Advanced Techniques
Deep Reinforcement Learning Extensions:
If you find that DQN is not sufficient for your needs, you could explore more advanced RL techniques like:
Double DQN (reduces overestimation of Q-values).
Dueling DQN (helps with the learning of state values).
A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) for more complex environments.
Transfer Learning:
If your AI will be in multiple environments, consider techniques that allow your model to transfer knowledge learned from one environment to another.



9. User Interface/World Design (if applicable)
AI Feedback:
Ensure your AI’s actions are understandable or interpretable to the user. If the AI interacts in an environment, you may want to display some of its reasoning or state to help the user understand the behavior (e.g., “I am afraid” or “I am preparing for battle”).



10. Documentation and Maintenance
Write Detailed Documentation:
Document all classes, methods, and logic so that it’s easier to extend and maintain the AI in the future.
Track Iterations:
Keep a record of the different changes you make to improve the AI’s decision-making, emotional feedback, and performance.
Summary of What to Learn and Focus On:

Emotion modeling and how emotions influence AI decisions.
Behavior trees or FSM for structured decision-making.
Reward shaping and learning from both successes and failures.
Unit testing and debugging of AI components.
Transfer learning if you plan on applying your AI to different scenarios.
Performance monitoring using metrics to track AI progress.
